#bug1
if you send big message at same time with anyother user sending a message exception occurs at server

#bug2
if people are chatting with alot of messages 
and someone leaves then an error occurs, 
what I got is that the gui script had failed we can check logs.
The person spamming got gui script failed, the person leaving faces no old messages
when he joins back, and after the spammer who caused this closses his script the message shows up
for the person who left and joined

Tasks:


3. Add print statements for the presentation
4. Make a ppt (probably)



doubt:
r=in recv , it is executed in synchronous manner onyl right! then is check statement required?
